    const text = `Thanks for accepting my request.

While writing this, ironically we both are in 12th.

Now I can finally share 
my ideas, daydreams, feelings, truths, lies, and everything in between.

As things were going , teachers used to make boys and girls sit together,
 others were really kinda thief and stubborn, but u were one of my fav. bench mates.
Then corona came and whole things got ruined.

As we chatted every day, I found myself getting really attached to you.
Afraid of being ignored, I lied about liking someone else. At that time,
I didn’t even like JK because his action had me thinking,
"NANI? How did he even take it like that"

Maybe he had better rizz with his partner, and you all were just love fools back then.
He and his bro really tried to stop me from speaking against them.
But despite all of this, I still remember our adventures (Class 10). 
Late chats with @creationwithtwovedas, Making fun of bulldog (if you remembered)
Make delete your meme account, 🤧 (Sanskrit classes) really enjoyed with you , Moksha,
and third name which makes u angry 🥲, 
PS: your cry makes me nearly cry though, so I didn't looked at u
Well thank God Google updated translator for Sanskrit🥸
PS: Can we really go back to those days?

After 10th, I thought it was time to rebuild good memories
and it was going better for months (it was a festival for me)
I used to remember whenever I go to Highway, specially near Panchgaon
I was in the bus, you were not attending your class instead 
you were chatting on Insta @kd_chillin (a day after many days)
And you asked me "I heard from Yashika that you liked me?" 
What could I answer? I said no.
Duh I was afraid that things are already on peak and
it would break this whole thing and
said no to prevent this shit but God was not merciful to me

PS: I used to think about it if I said yes, would things got better?

By mid-11th, I noticed a change—you seemed distant, hid things.
Pretty obvious since the whole friend circle had changed.
Your surroundings were different, and honestly, I didn’t like or cared for them.
The vibe felt off—brain-rotted, not even friendly
PS: I don't liked this period.

Then I found out that J and K were back together. That was the hardest cry I ever cried

But then I saw you both in CS. You were watching him, smiling.
That gave me relief, and after that, I never interfered between you two lovebirds.
But it didn’t last long. You broke up because he was too possessive about your social life,
and then you started hiding everything

Balma told me, "Just leave her and find someone else."
He was trying to motivate me, but honestly, he was having his own intentions through it.
In Akash, I found out people were crazy about you. Jerks who just talked shit.
I even met them when Balma invited them in his BD

Might times were better last year but realisation didn’t took place and I got failed,
even I didn't get a second chance for retest😓
After that, your sick zone attacked on my manner (Xavier effect—which I really don’t want to explain).
On the other side, I got threatening calls for days and days from Akash.
I knew a lot about DS, but you blocked me without even listening.
And after your third breakup, you didn’t even thank me😔

Nevermind🙂

Those months were depressing. Feeling helpless, hopeless, betrayed

But somehow, I made good friends in a junior class and started working on myself.

Between these days, your birthday was there, so wanted to gift you a sketch,
but working on few details, I got it ruined.

PS: If you noticed something, some details are similar 😉

 Eventually, during annual function prep, we talked after such a long time. I was happy again (really happy)

But by the evening of the picnic, you were distant again.
Hiding, walking ahead towards front seat. (Hope shattered once again)
PS:(Usually Overthinking is usual nowadays)

I planned to have a long conversation on farewell. But that day, I was crying too much, knowing you all were leaving school forever.
I especially felt like I was losing my last chance to face you. My tears made me speechless—I couldn’t say what I had planned

Still, you gave me a lollipop of hope of accepting my request. And I’m still waiting

Well as a friend I don’t know anyone as much as I know you, as I even know you more than myself,
I was confused 
Is it I liked you or am I only worried about that
Jerks like you, Maybe  your pale and serene colour 
Even though you are beautiful 
But even I like you more as a soul, that smile, the laughter we have,
that charisma, that aura, that voice, especially drums

PS: While IHC Group Dance (2023), the saree wore for kathak, that really got me blushed but also looking at you at the same time
And even in farewell also. You are always prettiest.

Nowadays lit. things surrounding me used to remember, especially you.
Like it's a list of infinite.
I used to dream (day and night), cruising together to various places,
capturing moments , if only as a FRIEND.
People were concerned about me and they used to say "she was this, she was that"
I ignored these things cause I don't even care, they don't know the bond we shared,
like HCl where the dipole moment is stronger towards you,  used to say myself "she got kinda curable delulu " 

I never wanted to lose you from my life because 
1. It's not the time
2. you were the only one I liked
And I don't see me in a future where I like anyone this much 
However only as a friend 
While being with me, your smile, laughter between us is enough for me 
Like your frequency really influences mine

Always want to keep you carefully 
Even you took place on my desktop 
Used to hide icon on other's intervention on my pc

Maybe It was not correct time for this kind of confession 
but it continues to making my chest pain and heart beat getting faster as of anxiety 

So is this the FINAL GOODBYE, or a few time is left ?
I don't think so because now I don't care anymore whoever think,
I am horrible as a person, because my mind and upper body feels really 
uncomfortable due to my shitty overthinking and dumb brain

Feels so cold and lonely due to emotions

PS: Expressing myself is too hard that's why I typing this whole message 
My brain really used to let go things but not my heart, "NOT THIS TIME"

またいっしょにともだちになれますか？
(Mata issho ni tomodachi ni naremasu ka?)
Can we be friends again?




But by the evening of March 11, 2025,
I came there to find you absorbed in your phone.
Your group didn't want me there - Perhaps you didn't either.
 Why did you change to be like them?

Yes, I finally understood - You wanted me to lose hope Of being with you.
Yet you never made it clear. Do you know the pain you caused? It's simple enough to understand now.
Perhaps this was what you wanted.

And now, Thank you for destroying an innocent belief.

Well, this is the end. Let these memories rest in peace. May God bless you and your family with prosperity.

Never expected this worse ending , even worser than Brigde to Terabethia and Titanic.


さよなら
(Sayonara)
Good Bye forever
